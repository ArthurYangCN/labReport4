Hi, here is the symtom I have. I am not sure why one of my tests fails. My guess is that my merge method logic is wrong.

### Response:
Hi. Do you think your 3rd while loop logic is correct? Also, you should check your imputs and your expected outputs. Check if they are what you want. You can try to use the bash command that we used in our lecture to run the tests.
