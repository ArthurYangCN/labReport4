## Lab Report 5

### Original Post:
Hi, here is the symtom I have. I am not sure why one of my tests fails. My guess is that my merge method logic is wrong.

### Response:
Hi. Do you think your 3rd while loop logic is correct? Also, you should check your imputs and your expected outputs. Check if they are what you want. You can try to use the bash command that we used in our lecture to run the tests.






























# Step4:

`ssh<space>shy020@ieng6.ucsd.edu<enter>`
I used `ssh` command to log into ieng6.
I used `<space>` and `<enter>` keys to successfully run the command.
# Step5:

`git<space>clone<space>https://github.com/ArthurYangCN/lab7<enter>`
I used `git` command to clone the file.
I used <space> and <enter> keys to successfully run the command.

# Step6:
`bash<space>test.sh<enter>`
I used `bash` command to run the test command in `test.sh` file.
I used <space> and <enter> keys to successfully run the command.

Results:


# Step7:
`vim ListExamples.java`
`G<enter>, 6k<enter>, f1<enter>, r2<enter>, :wq<enter>`
I used `vim` command to edit `ListExamples.java` file which contains error.
I used `G<enter>, 6k<enter>, f1<enter>, r2<enter>, :wq<enter>` to successfully change `index1 += 1;` to `index2 += 1;` to fix the problem.
I use `G` to move the cursor to the end of the document. Then, I count how many lines I should move to the target line. So, I press `6k`. Then `f1` to find the character 1. Lastly, `r2` to replace 1 to 2. `:wq` to exit the vim mode.

# Step8:
`bash<space>test.sh<enter>`
I used `bash` command to run the test command in `test.sh` file.
I used <space> and <enter> keys to successfully run the command.

Result:

# Step9:
```
git<space>status<enter>
git<space>add<space>.<enter>
git<space>commit<space>-m<space>"fix"<enter>
git<space>push<space>origin<space>main<enter>
```
I used `git` commands to update and push changes to github.
I used <space> and <enter> keys to successfully run the command.
